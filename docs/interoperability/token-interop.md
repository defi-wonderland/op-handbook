:::info reference
This is a high-level summary of token interoperability in the Superchain. For full technical details, see the [SuperchainERC20 explainer](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/superchain-erc20) and the [Specs](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html).
:::

Cross-chain token transfers in the Superchain are based on minting and burning, not wrapping or liquidity pools. The system uses two key components:

- `SuperchainERC20`: an ERC-20 extension with cross-chain mint and burn.
- `SuperchainTokenBridge`: a predeploy that handles message-based transfers.

This architecture enables fungibility across OP Chains with no liquidity fragmentation and 1-block latency.

## Overview

Each cross-chain transfer follows a simple flow:

**1. Burn** tokens on the source chain  
**2. Send** a message across chains  
**3. Mint** tokens on the destination chain

The process is secured by the OP Stack’s messaging protocol and enforced at the contract level.

## Contracts

| Contract | Role |
|---------|------|
| `SuperchainERC20` | Token interface. Adds `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`. |
| `SuperchainTokenBridge` | Controls bridging logic. Only this contract can mint/burn. |
| `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` | Message transport layer. |
| `CrossL2Inbox` | Verifies message validity. |

Although both `CrossL2Inbox` and `SuperchainTokenBridge` include safety checks and caller validation, they serve different roles. `CrossL2Inbox` enforces message origin validity, while `SuperchainTokenBridge` governs token movement and supply control. Their separation aligns with the modular OP Stack architecture.

## SuperchainERC20

This is an ERC-20 that implements [ERC-7802](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7802). It exposes two core methods:

```solidity
function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
function crosschainBurn(address from, uint256 amount) external;
```

Both are restricted to calls from the predeployed `SuperchainTokenBridge`. Calls from any other address revert.

```solidity
function crosschainBurn(address from, uint256 amount) external {
    if (msg.sender != Predeploys.SUPERCHAIN_TOKEN_BRIDGE) revert Unauthorized();
    _burn(from, amount);
    emit CrosschainBurn(from, amount, msg.sender);
}
```

The token must also be deployed at the same address on every OP Chain where it will be bridged. This can be done using `CREATE2` or the `OptimismSuperchainERC20Factory`.

## Bridging Workflow

**Source Chain**

	1.	The user calls `sendERC20(token, to, amount, destChainId)` on the `SuperchainTokenBridge`.
	2.	The bridge calls `crosschainBurn()` on the token.
	3.	It sends a message to the destination chain via `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`.

**Destination Chain**

	4.	A relayer submits the message.
	5.	The destination bridge receives it and calls `crosschainMint()` on the token.
	6.	The tokens are minted to the destination user.


## `SuperchainTokenBridge` Contract Walkthrough

### `sendERC20`
```solidity
function sendERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 chainId)
    external
    returns (bytes32 msgHash_)
{
    SuperchainERC20(token).crosschainBurn(msg.sender, amount);
    bytes memory message = abi.encodeCall(this.relayERC20, (token, msg.sender, to, amount));
    msgHash_ = L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(chainId, address(this), message);
    emit SentERC20(token, msg.sender, to, amount, chainId);
}
```

This function burns the tokens, crafts a message to relayERC20, and passes it through the cross-chain messenger.

### `relayERC20`
```solidity
function relayERC20(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger));
    require(L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.crossDomainMessageSender() == address(this));
    SuperchainERC20(token).crosschainMint(to, amount);
    emit RelayedERC20(token, from, to, amount, source);
}
```
This function is called on the destination chain. It verifies the message came from the correct sender and then mints tokens to the destination user.

## Deployment Requirements

To make a token interoperable:
- Deploy `SuperchainERC20` at the same address across all target chains.
- Grant `SuperchainTokenBridge` permission to mint and burn.
- (Optional) Use the `OptimismSuperchainERC20Factory` to deploy and register metadata.

## Invariants

These properties are enforced by the system:
- Conservation: Total supply across the Superchain must be preserved.
- Authorization: Only `SuperchainTokenBridge` can mint or burn.
- Determinism: The token must live at the same address on all chains.
- Unique messaging path: All transfers use `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`.

:::tip Can token supply change across chains?
The default Superchain bridge model enforces supply conservation: tokens must be burned on the source chain before being minted on the destination. However, custom bridges could intentionally mint or burn in specific cases (e.g. rewards or governance). These are not part of the standard `SuperchainTokenBridge` flow.
:::

## Rate Limiting

The standard `SuperchainTokenBridge` contract **does not enforce rate limits**. It assumes that safety and volume controls are handled by governance, economic incentives, or wrapper contracts.

However, some production deployments, like [`CrosschainERC20`](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/crosschainERC20), add **optional rate-limiting logic** as an extension. This implementation restricts the amount of tokens that can be transferred across chains within a fixed time window, mitigating the risk of sudden outflows due to bridge exploits or economic shocks.

These limits are enforced:
- **Per token**, per bridge instance
- **Per time window**, measured in L2 blocks

This design does not restrict *who* can bridge, only *how much* can be bridged in a given period.

:::info
Rate limiting is **not part of the default OP Stack bridge**. It is a feature of extended token implementations like `CrosschainERC20`.

## Comparison: `SuperchainERC20` vs `xERC20`

| Feature | SuperchainERC20 | xERC20 (ERC-7281) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trust model | OP Stack governance + fault proofs | Custom allowlist of bridges |
| Addressing | Same address on all chains | Flexible, but requires a registry |
| Permissions | Fixed bridge (SuperchainTokenBridge) | Configurable per bridge |
| Rate limiting | None in v1 | Native |
| Replay protection | Re-relaying the message on the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` | Optional |

`xERC20` offers more flexibility, but introduces a “weakest link” risk when multiple bridges are authorized. `SuperchainERC20` favors simplicity and safety, and they are compatible. 

The Superchain also supports a hybrid token implementation, the [`CrosschainERC20`](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/crosschainERC20/blob/dev/README.md), that combines both [ERC-7281](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7281-sovereign-bridged-tokens/14979) and [ERC-7802](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7802). This allows us to think about compatibility with xERC20-style bridges and the Superchain’s native interop model in a single token contract. So that devs can deploy new tokens or adapt existing ones using the provided factory, lockbox, and adapter contracts, while maintaining deterministic addresses across chains.

## What about NFTs?

ERC-721 bridging from L1 to L2 is still handled using the traditional `L1StandardBridge` and `L2StandardBridge` contracts. These follow the classic Merkle-proof model and are not yet supported by native interop. NFT support in the Superchain interop model is a potential future extension.

## TL;DR

Superchain token interoperability is simple: mint on destination, burn on source. The system uses native predeploys and permissioned bridges to ensure safety, determinism, and 1-block latency, without introducing fragmentation.
