# Processes

### Overview

Our development workflow is structured into the following main phases:

1. **Design Doc:** Identify the problem and outline a solution approach.
2. **Spec:** Define technical requirements and behaviors.
3. **Implementation:** Develop and test the solution.
4. **FMA (Feature & Maintenance Assessment):** Evaluate impacts and plan maintenance.

_Reference guideline: [Optimism SDLC](https://devdocs.optimism.io/pm/sdlc.html)_

**Note:**  
Include an extra internal step to ensure the handbook remains updated after each project.
