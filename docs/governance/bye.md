# Wrapping Up

To wrap up, where the OP Stack defines *how the system runs*, governance defines *how it changes*. It encodes: who can propose, who can vote, and who can veto. And because governance must evolve with the Collective, itâ€™s designed to be both programmable and flexibleâ€”via modules, managers, and community experimentation.

As youâ€™ve seen, governance isnâ€™t just about casting votes. Itâ€™s about trust minimization, fault tolerance, consent, and credible neutrality. The system must balance legitimacy with execution, and decentralization with security.

Now that youâ€™ve studied the full structure, we encourage you to sit with some deeper technical questions:

## ðŸ§  Questions to think about

<details>
<summary>Why separate the Governor from the Proposal Validator?</summary>

The Validator acts as a permissioned gatekeeper, enforcing off-chain rules (like delegate approval) in an on-chain format. It allows us to evolve the proposal logic independently from the core voting and execution engine. What trade-offs are we making in doing so?
</details>

<details>
<summary>What could go wrong if the ProposalTypesConfigurator is centralized?</summary>

Since quorum and approval thresholds depend on proposal type IDs, a compromised Configurator could lower requirements to push malicious proposals through. How would you design a decentralized alternative?
</details>

<details>
<summary>How would you detect a subdelegation abuse via Alligator?</summary>

If voting power is subdelegated to multiple downstream voters, how do we ensure no over-delegation occurs? What data structures or interfaces would help us prevent double-spending of votes?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can we remove the Manager role entirely?</summary>

What would need to change in the system to remove the Manager's power to submit proposals, configure thresholds, or change voting deadlines? Could this be replaced with a DAO-controlled policy engine?
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does 'forkability' look like in governance?</summary>

If a delegate or group of citizens disagrees with the direction of governance, can they fork the system? What technical mechanisms or social affordances (e.g. reproducible config, open contracts) enable this?
</details>

### Keep Building

Governance is never done. If you're working on tooling, researching modules, or helping design the next iteration of participation, it shapes the protocol!
