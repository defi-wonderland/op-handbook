This section documents active governance-related development initiatives led by or contributed to Wonderland. While the previous sections described how the governance system functions today, this space focuses on improvements in progress—features that are being designed, discussed, or implemented. Some initiatives are in early stages; others are already live onchain.

## Why it matters

The governance is designed to evolve. Improvements often arise from practical bottlenecks observed by delegates, contributors, and protocol developers. This section records how those pain points are being addressed—through new contracts, improved interfaces, or procedural upgrades.

Each entry aims to explain:

- The motivation for the change
- How the proposed solution works
- Key trade-offs or risks involved
- Links to contracts, proposals, or diagrams

## Included so far

- [Permissionless Proposals](./permissionless-proposals.md): Automating the proposal submission process to remove reliance on gatekeeping, while preserving collective approval via delegate sign-offs.

As the governance system grows, this section will expand to include changes to proposal types, validator flows, delegate tooling, and so on.
