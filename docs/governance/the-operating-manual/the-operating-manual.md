# The Operating Manual (v0.4.2)

In this section we will describe the current governance proposal process of the Collective. It will evolve over time. The authoritative version is maintained [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md) on GitHub.

## Bicameral Governance

The Optimism Collective is governed by two Houses:
- **Token House**: OP holders submit, deliberate, and vote on governance proposals. They can vote directly or delegate voting power to an eligible third party (a delegate).
- **Citizens’ House**: Optimism Citizens allocate resources through Retro Funding. Citizenship is temporary and evolving via experimentation with Guest Voters. Citizens also vote on Retro Funding mission scope, budget, and can veto certain proposals.

All representatives are expected to act in accordance with the Rules of Engagement and Optimist Expectations.

## Governance Toolkit
| Tool | Description |
|------|------------|
| [Token House Governance Contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcdf27f107725988f2261ce2256bdfcde8b382b10) | On-chain voting for Token House proposals |
| [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/) | Vote and delegate OP on-chain |
| [Citizens' House Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:citizenshouse.eth) | Vote interface for Citizens' House |
| [Optimism Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/) | Proposal discussion and feedback |
| [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) | Informal governance chat |
| [Grants GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues) | Foundation Mission proposals and discussion |
| [Charmverse](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208) | Home of the Optimism Grants Council |

These tools may change as governance evolves.

## Proposal Process

Anyone may submit a governance proposal if it fits one of the valid types (listed below) and follows the voting process.

Most proposals follow a three-week cycle:

- Week 1–2: Feedback and Review **[Draft]**
    - Proposals are posted to the Forum for community feedback.
    - Must be formatted per the standard proposal template.
    - Four top 100 delegates or four Citizens must explicitly approve for the proposal to move to vote.
    - They indicate this by commenting: *'I am an Optimism [delegate/Citizen] [link], and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.'*

- Week 3: Voting
    -  Voting lasts 7 days via Optimism Governance Portal (Token House) or Snapshot (Citizens’ House).
    - Snapshot of voting power is taken at the start of the voting period.
    - Quorum and approval thresholds depend on the Proposal Type.

## Veto Process

Certain proposals can be vetoed by the other House:
| Proposal Origin | Veto House | Threshold |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Token House (e.g. Protocol Upgrade) | Citizens' House | 30% of Citizens |
| Citizens' House Proposal | Token House | 30% of votable OP supply |

Vetoes are a serious mechanism, reserved for malicious proposals or cases of governance capture.

## Valid Proposal Types
| Proposal Type | Proposing House | Vote Duration | Quorum | Approval | Veto Rights |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Governance Fund (Missions) | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 51% | — |
| Protocol / Governor Upgrade | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 76% | Citizens' House |
| Maintenance Upgrade | Both Houses | 1w optimistic vote | — | — | Both Houses (12%) |
| Inflation Adjustment | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 76% | Citizens' House |

| Representative Removal | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 51% | — |
| Structure Dissolution | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 51% | — |
| Ratification | Both Houses | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 51% | — |
| Reflection Period | Token House | 2w review + 1w vote | 30% | 51% | — |

See templates [this template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/standard-proposal-template-optimism-token-house/5443) for proposal types.
 
## Retro Funding

Retro Funding Missions are managed by the Citizens’ House and follow these steps:
1. **Scoping**: Vote on budget + mission scope.
2. **Application**: Projects apply via OP Atlas.
3. **Review**: Applications reviewed for eligibility.
4. **Voting**: Citizens vote on impact and allocate rewards.
5. **Disbursement**: Grants distributed to winning projects.
6. **Compliance**: Projects complete KYC and compliance review.

For example, Retro Funding in 2025 includes:
- **Onchain Builders Mission**: Up to 8M OP to support Superchain adoption and interop.
- **Dev Tooling Mission**: Up to 8M OP for foundational open-source infrastructure.

## Experimentation with Citizenship

The Citizens’ House was created to:
- Counterbalance Token House plutocracy
- Reward long-term public goods
- Increase resilience via diverse representation

Experiments with Guest Voters are ongoing. The Citizen Attestation Schema tracks active Citizens.

Experiments follow this principles:
- Measurable inputs + outcomes
- Short feedback cycles
- Reversibility (e.g. guest voter rounds)

## Implementation & Administration

The Optimism Foundation:
- Moderates proposals and enforces submission requirements
- Monitors quorum and thresholds
- Administers emergency upgrades and manages network operations
- Routes approved proposals to implementation
- Collects compliance information

Over time, its role is expected to decentralize. Security-critical upgrades are enacted by the Security Council (SC).

## Change Process

The manual evolves alongside governance. Each release is versioned and published here. Future updates may include:
- New Proposal Types
- Expanded veto powers
- Full community maintenance

Only the removal of a Proposal Type requires a governance vote.
