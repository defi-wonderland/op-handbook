# Citizensâ€™ House

The Citizensâ€™ House is one half of the Optimism Collectiveâ€™s bicameral governance system. It exists to complement the Token House by representing long-term interests, distributing Retro Funding, and safeguarding the Collective from plutocratic capture.

## Purpose

The Citizensâ€™ House was designed to:
- Counterbalance the short-term incentives of token governance
- Safeguard the Collective from capture or misaligned influence
- Allocate resources to public goods that generate long-term impact
- Promote experimentation with novel governance forms

Its core responsibility is managing the Retro Funding, and, increasingly, participating in veto powers over key governance proposals.

## What is a Citizen?

Citizens are individuals who hold an attestation of citizenship, managed via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Citizenship is currently:
- Temporary, and may evolve through experimental iterations
- Granted experimentally, often through guest voter rounds
- Revocable, if criteria are no longer met or based on conduct

## Experimentation with Citizenship

As we said in the previous section, the Collective takes an evidence-based, experimental approach to designing Citizenship.

Core principles for experimentation:
- Measurability: Inputs (selection methods) and outputs (governance impact) must be quantifiable
- Short feedback cycles: Regular Retro Funding rounds accelerate learning
- Reversibility: Guest voters are a lightweight, reversible way to test new systems
- Rich identity layer: Building mechanisms to link contributions, engagement, and reputation to identity

Citizenship design should always be evaluated based on its ability to meet these objectives.

## Citizensâ€™ House Governance

The Citizensâ€™ House governs primarily through two processes:

1. Retro Funding Missions
    - Citizens vote on how public goods are rewarded
    - Missions follow clear stages: scoping â†’ applications â†’ review â†’ voting â†’ disbursement â†’ compliance
    - Voting takes place on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/citizenshouse.eth) with EAS-verified Citizen identities

2. Veto Powers: Citizens have the ability to veto certain governance proposals approved by the Token House.

    | Proposal Type | Veto Threshold | Notes |
    |--------------|----------------|--------|
    | Protocol/Governor Upgrade | 30% of Citizens | Must veto within 1 week of Token House vote |
    | Maintenance Upgrades | 12% of Citizens | Used only in time-sensitive updates |

    A vetoed proposal is not enacted.

## Guest Voters

Guest voters are temporary Citizens selected for experimental rounds of Retro Funding. They:
- Help test new selection methods
- Are not full Citizens (e.g., cannot cast vetoes)
- Enable reversibility in experiments

Inputs and outputs are measured via:
- Surveys to voters and applicants
- Voting behavior analysis
- Social graph analysis
- Reputation signals (contributions, usage, etc.)

These experiments are key to growing the Collectiveâ€™s high-confidence knowledge around what makes an effective Citizen.

## Identity and Reputation

A scalable and ethical identity layer is critical for:
- Selecting Citizens based on meaningful criteria (e.g., dev contributions, app usage, community participation)
- Enabling rich experimentation
- Tracking performance and refining governance systems

Citizenship design relies on integrating onchain identity, offchain reputation, and collective legitimacy.

## Responsabilities 

Citizens are expected to:
	â€¢	Vote thoughtfully in Retro Funding
	â€¢	Participate in governance deliberation
	â€¢	Evaluate proposals using impact-aligned criteria
	â€¢	Respect the Rules of Engagement
	â€¢	Provide feedback during experimental rounds
	â€¢	Act in the Collectiveâ€™s long-term interest

## Foundation and Constitution

Citizensâ€™ House governance is grounded in:
- [The Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55)
- The principle of anti-plutocracy: influence should not be limited to token holders
- The vision of impact = profit: public goods should be rewarded by their outcomes

Over time, the community is expected to take increasing ownership of Citizen selection, Retro Funding design, and proposal evaluation.
